## Purpose and Objectives

**Key Features:**

- Menu items are categorized to improve user navigation.
- Each item includes a photo, ingredients list, and price.
- Pricing includes student discounts and other available offers.
- Conditional rendering handles "Out of Stock" and "Coming Soon" items dynamically through data—no code manipulation needed.
- Codebase is modular and well-organized for maintainability and scalability.
- Simple and colorful animations enhance user experience.

 

## How to Contribute or Run Locally

## Future Improvements

While the project fulfills its current purpose, the following enhancements could improve functionality and user experience:

- Integrating the university’s financial system to enable features like online ordering, payments, and use of student discount codes.
- Implementing a user authentication system to allow sign-up/login, manage past orders, save favorite items, and manage a shopping cart.
- Creating an admin dashboard for cafeteria staff to manage menu items and monitor user activity, such as order completions.
- Adding English as a second language for international students
